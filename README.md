# R2A

---

## Features

- Support for core RISC-V instruction sets:
    - **RV32I**
    - **RV64I**
    - **RV32M**
- Accurate label generation
- Parse raw binary (.bin) files in little-endian
- No external dependencies apart from python
- Built for extension: ideal foundation for simulators or assemblers

## Limitations

- ELF files not supported
- No validation or instruction legality checks
- No pseduoinstructions

## Roadmap

- More instruction sets
- ELF file parsing
- Legality checks
- Library + GUI application
